1. I downloaded a dataset from UCI. 
2. The raw files are in CancerData
3. I edited wdbc.data in the cancerdata directory, I change the seperator from "," to " ". I also
   change the indicator for cancer and recurrent from characters to 0 and 1. 
4. The resulting files is stored in the project directory. 
5. The script is in DataProcessing.awk 
6. To run the code awk -f DataProcessing.awk wpbc.data 
   the file produces a TOP directory containing index.html and
   subdirectories c04-c14. Each directory contains 12 javascript plots.
   aa.html   plots all the patients in groups of 10 in a bar graph
   ca.html   plots cancerous patients in a group of 10 in a bar graph 
   na.html   plots non-cancerous patients in a group of 10 in a bar graph
   co.html   plots a comparison between the cancerous and con-cancerous for that measurement
   the javascript was downloaded from canvasjs.com
   the script is broken into 3 parts, p1.txt, p2.txt and p3.txt
   the script generates a title which is stored temporarily in title.txt and a set of data to be plotted 
   in file outf1
   to generate the javascript issue a system command as follow 
        
        cmd = "cat ./Files/p1.txt title.txt ./Files/p2.txt outf1 ./Files/p3.txt  > "  cdir "/aa.html"
       	system(cmd)
    
   this command generates the plot for all patients
   similarly the data is collected and printed for ca and aa and system command is used 
   
7. There are 10 parameter measured 3 different ways the 6 is repeated for each way the parameter is measured 
    the plots are stored in the appropriate directories under TOP
    
8.  I created using vi an index.html which points to the correct plot for each measurement, that file is stored
    in Files
    The script copies the index.html file into TOP directory each time the script runs

9.  To view the results open index.html with any browser
